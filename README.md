# PetFeeder Project

This repository includes the codebase for creating a comprehensive solution for pet care, incorporating the integration of sensors to facilitate feeding routines and a web application to control various operational modes effectively.

The project documentation, offering detailed insights into the functionalities, design decisions, and operational aspects of both the pet feeding system and the associated web application, is available for review in the PDF file included in the repository.
